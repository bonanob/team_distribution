# Project 2: Basketball Stats Tool

The app creates structures to store and organize a team of basketball players into teams. It will balance the teams by the total number of players and generate some statistics for a given team. Player data is imported from constants.py and is built into a structure of nested arrays.

**How to run the project locally:**

If you have python installed, have both `.py` files in a folder and run `app.py`

**What I've learned:**

- Importing data from files
- Building data structure using nested dictionaries
- Cleaning data
- Validating user input

**Flow:**

1. User is prompted to see stats or quit.
2. User is prompted to choose a team.
3. Stats of the chosen team are shown.
4. User is prompted to redivide the teams (y/n)

**Notes:**

- Players are redistributed every time you start or restart the app.
