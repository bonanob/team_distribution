# Project 2: Basketball Stats Tool
1. Import from constants.py the players' data to be used within your program.
2. Read the existing player and team data from the PLAYERS and TEAMS constants provided in constants.py and build a new collection.

HINT: Think Lists with nested Dictionaries might be one way.

NOTE: Ensure you do not directly modify the data in PLAYERS or TEAMS constants. This data you should iterate and read from to build your own collection and would be ideal to clean the data as you loop over it building your new collection.
